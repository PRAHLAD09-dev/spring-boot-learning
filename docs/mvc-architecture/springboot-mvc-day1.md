# Spring Boot MVC — Day 1

Today I implemented a basic Spring Boot MVC project using Thymeleaf.

---

## What I built
- Multi-controller MVC structure
- Class-level and method-level request mappings
- Page navigation using controller → view flow
- Data passing from controller to view using Model
- Thymeleaf-based view rendering

---

## Controllers Implemented
- HomeController
- UserController
- AdminController

---

## Pages (Views)
- home.html
- profile.html
- dashboard.html
- profit.html

---

## Concepts Practiced
- @Controller
- @RequestMapping
- @GetMapping
- Controller → View flow
- MVC architecture
- Model data passing
- Thymeleaf integration

---

## MVC Flow
Request  
→ Controller  
→ Model (data)  
→ Thymeleaf View  
→ Response (HTML)

---

## Tools
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- Maven
- Java 21

## Status
