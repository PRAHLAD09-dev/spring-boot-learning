## Spring Boot MVC — Day 1

Today I implemented a basic Spring Boot MVC project using Thymeleaf.

### What I built

- Navigation between pages
- Data passing using Model
- Thymeleaf view rendering

### Controllers
- HomeController
- UserController
- AdminController

### Pages
- home.html
- profile.html
- dashboard.html
- profit.html

### Concepts Practiced
- @Controller
- @RequestMapping
- @GetMapping
- MVC flow (Controller → View)
- Thymeleaf integration

Status: MVC Day-1 Completed

### DAY 2 — Spring Boot MVC (Forms & POST Mapping)
